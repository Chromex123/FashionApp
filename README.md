## Overview
An Android fashion inspiration app that allows users to:
- Upload their favorite outfits and post them instantly
- Explore a real-time news feed (updates when you swipe to refresh)
- Search and filter posts by styles to discover style inspiration from others
- Save your favorite posts containing outfits that inspire you
- Built with a fragment-based architecture and a clean, intuitive UI for a seamless user experience.
  
Everything’s anonymous, so it’s all about the **fashion**, not the follower count.
